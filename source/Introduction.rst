My idea 
#######
Since 1986 I have been interested in computer graphics. I started with simple stuff on C16 and later on an Anmiga, went to PC and wrote my first
3D-Program based on the Painter's-Algorithm in 1996 ( see https://github.com/kimkulling/osre_doc/edit/main/source/Introduction.rst). 

In 2003 I helped the ZFX-Team with the ZFX-Community-Engine ( more info's here, only german: https://de-academic.com/dic.nsf/dewiki/1547500). 

Every time I worked on the engine stuff I realized that I did not have any plan for doing all the interesting stuff. I missed the 
deeper knowledge which is most important for writing 3D-Software, which other people can use. So I decided to restart from scratch and 
started to work on the OSRE: Just another Open-Source-Render-Engine. This is just a side-project for me. I am trying to implement things like

- How to implement a multithreaded renderer?
- How shall a multi-platform layer look like?
- Learn OpenGL and Vulkan
- Implement an asset-loader for assimp-based models
- Doing lighting right
- Implement a simple bitmap-font renderer
- ...
