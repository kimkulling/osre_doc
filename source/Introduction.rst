My idea 
#######
Since 1986 I am interested in computer graphics. I started with simple stuff on C16 and lateron on an Anmiga, went to PC's and wrote my first
3D-Program based on the Painter's-Algorithm in 1996 ( see https://github.com/kimkulling/osre_doc/edit/main/source/Introduction.rst). 

In 2003 I help the ZFX-Team with the ZFX-Community-Engine ( more info's are here, only german: https://de-academic.com/dic.nsf/dewiki/1547500). 

Everytime when I had worked on the engine-stuff I realized that I do not have any plan how to do all the interesting stuff. I missed the 
deeper knowledge which is most importand for writing 3D-Software, which can b used by other people. So I decided to restart from scratch and 
started to work on the OSRE: Just another Open-Source-Render-Engine. This is just a side-project for me. I am trying to implement things like

- Writing my own multithreaded renderer 
- How shall a multi-platform layer looks like
- Learn OpenGL and Vulkan
- Implement an asset-loader for assimp-based models
- Doing lightning right
- Implement a simple bitmap-font renderer
- Render UI-elements right 

and many more. And here is my place to play around with these things.
